# Chatbot UI

This repository is forked from [Chatbot UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui).
Chatbot UI is an open source chat UI for AI models.
I have made some changes, so it can chat with workstream's chatbot server.
This project is only used in local development mode, not for production.
